What is MSGReader
=========

MSGReader is a C# .NET 4.5 and Standard 2.0 (supports C# .NET 4.6.1 and up) library to read Outlook MSG and EML (Mime 1.0) files. Almost all common object in Outlook are supported:

- E-mail
- Appointment
- Task
- Contact card
- Sticky note

It supports all body types there are in MSG files, this includes:

- Text
- HTML
- HTML embedded into RTF
- RTF

MSGReader has only a few options to manipulate an MSG file. The only option you have is that you can remove attachments and then save the file to a new one.

If you realy want to write MSG files then see my MsgKit project on GitHub (https://github.com/Sicos1977/MsgKit)

Read properties from an Outlook (msg) message
============
```c#
using (var msg = new MsgReader.Outlook.Storage.Message("d:\\testfile.msg"))
{
        var from = msg.Sender;
        var sentOn = msg.SentOn;
        var recipientsTo = msg.GetEmailRecipients(MsgReader.Outlook.RecipientType.To, false, false);
        var recipientsCc = msg.GetEmailRecipients(MsgReader.Outlook.RecipientType.Cc, false, false);
        var subject = msg.Subject;
        var htmlBody = msg.BodyHtml;
        // etc...
}
```

Read properties from an Outlook (eml) message
============
```c#
var fileInfo = new FileInfo("d:\\testfile.eml");
var eml = MsgReader.Mime.Message.Load(fileInfo);

if (eml.Headers != null)
{
        if (eml.Headers.To != null)
        {
            foreach (var recipient in eml.Headers.To)
            {
                var to = recipient.Address;            
            }
        }
}

var subject = eml.Headers.Subject;

if (eml.TextBody != null)
{
        var textBody = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eml.TextBody.Body);
}

if (eml.HtmlBody != null)
{
        var htmlBody = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eml.HtmlBody.Body);
}

// etc...
```

Delete attachment from an Outlook message
============

This example deletes the first attachment

```c#
var outlook = new Storage.Message(fileName, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
outlook.DeleteAttachment(outlook.Attachments[0]);
outlook.Save("d:\\deleted.msg");
```

Installing via NuGet
====================

The easiest way to install MSGReader is via NuGet.

In Visual Studio's Package Manager Console, simply enter the following command:

    Install-Package MSGReader


Side note
=========

This project can also be used from a COM based language like VB script or VB6.
To use it first compile the code and register the com visible assembly with the command:

Regasm.exe /codebase MsgReader.dll

After that you can call it like this:

```vb
dim msgreader

set msgreader = createobject("MsgReader.Reader")
msgreader.ExtractToFolderFromCom "the msg file to read", "the folder where to place the extracted files"
```
